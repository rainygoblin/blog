[How to make a background process when app is not running](https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/how-to-make-a-background-process-when-app-is-not-running/41859)

I am writing a sunrise and sunset app. The app is to fire audio alerts when the sun rises and sets.

I got the whole thing sorted out under Android thanks to the following 2 plugins:

``` bash
de.appplant.cordova.plugin.background-mode
cordova-plugin-autostart
```
